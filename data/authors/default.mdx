## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Abdullahi Usman

I'm a software developer and emerging tech leader based in Nigeria, specializing in building practical, user-focused digital solutions <Twemoji emoji="laptop" />. My work spans front-end engineering, automation, AI-powered features, and modern product development—consistently shaped by a drive to solve real problems with clean, scalable systems.

My current projects reflect this passion:

SignPen — a digital sign-out and clearance platform built to modernize student documentation workflows with seamless UI, secure authentication, and smart automation.

LodgeApp Preview — a Next.js platform helping students locate safe, verified off-campus accommodation through community reviews and essential resources.

Sui Blockchain Agricultural App — a Web3 innovation for land rental, equipment access, farm product sales, and investor engagement using Sui tokens.

WhatsApp Automation Bots — tools that support departmental communication, announcements, and digital engagement with minimal friction.

NAOSS & Department Digital Systems — structured platforms that improve information flow, media management, and student experience across my campus communities.

Beyond building, I’m deeply involved in tech leadership. I’ve hosted an MLH Hackday, helping students explore innovation and hands-on problem-solving, and I serve as the Deputy Team Lead for FSI on my campus—guiding people through product development, collaboration, and efficient team practices.

While tech is my core focus, my academic journey in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering <Twemoji emoji="grad" /> and my student leadership roles—President of my Department, General Secretary of NAOSS FUTMINNA, and Chief Press Secretary to the SUG Vice President—help me bring structure, communication, and execution to every project I work on.

When I’m off the keyboard, you’ll find me creating videos or animations <Twemoji emoji="movie" />, or enjoying music <Twemoji emoji="headphones" />—the creative sparks that recharge my mind.

🤖 I’m currently expanding my depth in AI concepts, refining my front-end expertise with React and Next.js, and maintaining consistency through my 100-Day Coding Challenge. Constant growth is my culture, and I'm always exploring the next idea that blends creativity, impact, and technology.
